Welcome to the homepage for Luke Nihlen. I'm a software developer focused on compilers and programming languages. In the
past, I've worked on video games and simulations, virtual reality, and web video. I've worked at Google since 2010, but
the views represented here are mine alone and not representative of my employer.

At Google, I work on the compiler toolchain that builds Chrome, Chrome OS, and our production infrastructure. Outside of
work, I tinker with [Hadron](https://hadron-sclang.org), a new compiler implementation of the
[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) programming language.

I enjoy video games, cooking, and music. I live in rural Ontario with my wife Hilary and two doggies, Molly and Storm.
